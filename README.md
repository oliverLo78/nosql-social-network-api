## Description

Description text

While building this project I learned to:

- create a application using mongoDB instead of mySQL and the Mongoose 
- include schema to create user model 
- to transform Objects after querying MongoDb: toJSON and toObject.
- use .populate to populate thoughts and reactions for that User
